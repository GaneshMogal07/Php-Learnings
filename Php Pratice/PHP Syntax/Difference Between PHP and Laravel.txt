1Ô∏è‚É£ What is PHP?
1.PHP is a programming/scripting language.
2.Full form: PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
3.It is used to build server-side web applications.
4.With PHP, you can write your own logic from scratch (handling forms, connecting to databases, creating sessions, etc.).

Example: Simple PHP code

<?php
echo "Hello, I am PHP!";
?>



2Ô∏è‚É£ What is Laravel?
1.Laravel is a framework built on top of PHP.
2.Think of it as a ready-made toolkit that makes PHP development faster, easier, and more organized.
3.It provides pre-built features like:
4.Routing (managing URLs)
5.Authentication (login, registration)
6.Database management (with Eloquent ORM)
7.Security features (CSRF protection, hashing)
8.MVC structure (Model-View-Controller)

üëâ Example: Laravel code for displaying "Hello World" (in a route)

Route::get('/hello', function () {
    return "Hello, I am Laravel!";
});

| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**                 | A scripting language                                 | A framework built using PHP                                 |
| **Usage**                | Write raw code to handle everything manually         | Provides ready-made tools for faster development            |
| **Learning Curve**       | Easy to start (beginner-friendly)                    | Steeper learning curve (need PHP basics first)              |
| **Structure**            | No structure (you decide how to organize)            | Uses MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture               |
| **Speed of Development** | Slower, you build features from scratch              | Faster, because of built-in tools                           |
| **Security**             | You must handle manually (SQL injection, CSRF, etc.) | Provides built-in security features                         |
| **Database Handling**    | Manual SQL queries (e.g., `mysqli_query`)            | Uses **Eloquent ORM** (easy way to interact with databases) |
| **Best For**             | Small projects, learning basics                      | Large/complex applications, enterprise projects             |
